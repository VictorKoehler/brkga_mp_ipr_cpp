BRKGA-MP-IPR provides a _very easy-to-use_ framework for the
Multi-Parent Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with Implict Path Relink
(**BRKGA-MP-IPR**). Assuming that your have a _decoder_ to your problem,
we can setup, run, and extract the value of the best solution in less than
5 commands (obvisiously, you may need few other lines fo code to do a proper
test).

This C++ version provides a fast prototyping API using C++14 standards and
libraries. All code was developed as a header-only library, and have no
external dependencies other than those included in the package. So, you just
need to copy/check out the files and point your compiler's header path to
BRKGA-MP-IPR folder (`-I` on G++ and CLANG++).

This framework can use multiple threads of modern CPUs, by setting a single
parameter (assuming that your decoder is thread-safe). This leverage the
parallel decoding nature that BRKGAs offer, compared to other (meta)
heuristic frameworks.

The code can be compiled using [> GCC 7.2](https://gcc.gnu.org) and [> Clang
6.0](https://clang.llvm.org), and it is very probable that it can be compiled
using other modern C++ compilers, such as Intel and Microsoft compilers. To
use multiple threads, your compiler must support
[OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org). The current version has been long developed,
and it is a very mature code used in production in several companies.
However, it lacks of a proper unit and coverage testing. Such tests are in
the TODO list.

If C++ is not suitable to you, we may find useful the [**Julia
version**](https://github.com/ceandrade/brkga_mp_ipr_julia) of this framework.
We are also developing a
[**Python version**](https://github.com/ceandrade/brkga_mp_ipr_python)
which is in its earlier stages.
At this moment, we have no plans to implement the BRKGA-MP-IPR in other
languages such as Java or C#. But if you want to do so, you are
must welcome. But please, keep the API as close as possible to the C++ API
(or Julia API in case you decide go C), and use the best coding and
documentation practices of your chosen language/framework.

- [**Julia version**](https://github.com/ceandrade/brkga_mp_ipr_julia)
- [**Python version**](https://github.com/ceandrade/brkga_mp_ipr_python)

If you are not familiar with how BRKGA works, take a look on
[Standard BRKGA](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10732-010-9143-1) and
[Multi-Parent BRKGA](http://dx.doi.org/xxx).
In the future, we will provide a _Prime on BRKGA-MP_
section.

:computer: Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BRKGA-MP-IPR is a header-only framework, which means that you only need to
download the header files and tell your compiler to include the path to where
the files were downloaded.

Quick example (unix): assume we are in an empty folder. So, we copy/clone
BRKGA-IPR-MP first:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ceandrade/brkga_mp_ipr_cpp
    Cloning into 'brkga_mp_ipr_cpp'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 118, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (118/118), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (112/112), done.
    remote: Total 118 (delta 24), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Receiving objects: 100% (118/118), 3.50 MiB | 3.66 MiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (24/24), done.

Let's write a `test.cpp` with the following code:

```cpp
#include "brkga_mp_ipr.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Testing sense: " << BRKGA::Sense::MINIMIZE;
    return 0;
}
```

Then, let's compile and see it works:

    $ g++ --version
    g++ (MacPorts gcc8 8.2.0_3) 8.2.0

    $ g++ -std=c++14 -Ibrkga_mp_ipr/brkga_mp_ipr test.cpp -o test

    $ ./test
    Testing sense: MINIMIZE

Note the Git clones the whole repository that contains the library code,
documents, and examples. All the examples were built using
[GNU/Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and
[GCC toolchain](https://gcc.gnu.org). However, the code is standard C++,
and we can quickly adapt it to other toolchains such as
[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org),
[Microsoft](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com), or
[Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/c-compilers) toolchains.
To build this documentation, we also need
[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl).

:zap: Usage - TL;DR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The best way to keep it short is to look in the
on examples on [the git repo.](https://github.com/ceandrade/brkga_mp_ipr_cpp/tree/master/examples)
Let's take a look into
[`main_minimal.cpp`](https://github.com/ceandrade/brkga_mp_ipr_cpp/blob/master/examples/tsp/src/main_minimal.cpp),
which solves the
[Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).
This is a trimmed copy:

```cpp
#include "tsp/tsp_instance.hpp"
#include "decoders/tsp_decoder.hpp"
#include "brkga_mp_ipr.hpp"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if(argc < 4) {
        cerr << "Usage: "<< argv[0]
             << " <seed> <config-file> <num-generations>"
                " <tsp-instance-file>" << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    const unsigned seed = stoi(argv[1]);
    const string config_file = argv[2];
    const unsigned num_generations = stoi(argv[3]);
    const string instance_file = argv[4];

    auto instance = TSP_Instance(instance_file);

    auto params = BRKGA::readConfiguration(config_file);
    auto& brkga_params = params.first;

    TSP_Decoder decoder(instance);

    BRKGA::BRKGA_MP_IPR<TSP_Decoder> algorithm(
            decoder, BRKGA::Sense::MINIMIZE, seed,
            instance.num_nodes, brkga_params);

    algorithm.initialize();

    algorithm.evolve(num_generations);

    auto best_cost = algorithm.getBestFitness();
    cout << "Best cost: " << best_cost;

    return 0;
}
```

You can identify the following basic steps:

1. Create a data structure to hold your input data. This object should be passed
   to the decoder object/functor (example
   [`tsp/tsp_instance.hpp`](https://github.com/ceandrade/brkga_mp_ipr_cpp/blob/master/examples/tsp/src/tsp/tsp_instance.hpp));

2. Implement a decoder object/functor. This function translates a chromosome
   (array of numbers in the interval [0,1]) to a solution for your problem. The
   decoder must return the solution value or cost to be used as fitness by BRKGA
   (example
   [`decoders/tsp_decoder.hpp`](https://github.com/ceandrade/brkga_mp_ipr_cpp/blob/master/examples/tsp/src/decoders/tsp_decoder.hpp));

3. Load the instance and other relevant data;

4. Read the algorithm parameters using `BRKGA::readConfiguration()`; or
   create a `BRKGA::BrkgaParams` object by hand;

5. Create an `BRKGA::BRKGA_MP_IPR` algorithm object;

6. Call `BRKGA::BRKGA_MP_IPR::initialize()` to init the BRKGA state;

7. Call `BRKGA::BRKGA_MP_IPR::evolve()` to optimize;

8. Call `BRKGA::BRKGA_MP_IPR::getBestFitness()` and/or
   `BRKGA::BRKGA_MP_IPR::getBestChromosome()` to retrieve the best solution.

[`main_minimal.cpp`](https://github.com/ceandrade/brkga_mp_ipr_cpp/blob/master/examples/tsp/src/main_minimal.cpp)
provides a very minimal example to understand the necessary steps to use the
BRKGA-MP-IPR framework. However,
[`main_complete.cpp`](https://github.com/ceandrade/brkga_mp_ipr_cpp/blob/master/examples/tsp/src/main_complete.cpp)
provides a full-featured code, handy for scientific use, such as
experimentation and paper writing. This code allows fine-grained control of
the optimization, shows several features of BRKGA-MP-IPR such as the resets,
chromosome injection, and others. It also logs
all optimization steps, _creating outputs easy to be parsed._ **You should use
this code for serious business and experimentation.**
