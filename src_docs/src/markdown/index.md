BRKGA-MP-IPR Guide and Documentation {#mainpage}
================================================================================

BRKGA-MP-IPR provides a _very easy-to-use_ framework for the
Multi-Parent Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with Implict Path Relink
(**BRKGA-MP-IPR**). Assuming that your have a _decoder_ to your problem,
we can setup, run, and extract the value of the best solution in less than
5 commands (obvisiously, you may need few other lines fo code to do a proper
test).

This C++ version provides a fast prototyping API using C++14 standards and
libraries. All code was developed as a header-only library, and have no
external dependencies other than those included in the package. So, you just
need to copy/check out the files and point your compiler's header path to
BRKGA-MP-IPR folder (`-I` on G++ and CLANG++).

This framework can use multiple threads of modern CPUs, by setting a single
parameter (assuming that your decoder is thread-safe). This leverage the
parallel decoding nature that BRKGAs offer, compared to other (meta)
heuristic frameworks.

The code can be compiled using [> GCC 7.2](https://gcc.gnu.org) and [> Clang
6.0](https://clang.llvm.org), and it is very probable that it can be compiled
using other modern C++ compilers, such as Intel and Microsoft compilers. To
use multiple threads, your compiler must support
[OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org). The current version has been long developed,
and it is a very mature code used in production in several companies.
However, it lacks of a proper unit and coverage testing. Such tests are in
the TODO list.

If C++ is not suitable to you, we may find useful the [Julia
version](https://github.com/ceandrade/BrkgaMpIpr.jl) of this framework. At
this moment, we have no plans to implement the BRKGA-MP-IPR in other
languages such as Python, Java, or C#. Both if you want to do so, you are
must welcome. But please, keep the API as close as possible to the C++ API
(or Julia API in case you decide go C), and use the best coding and
documentation practices of your chosen language/framework.

If you are not familiar with how BRKGA works, take a look on
[Standard BRKGA](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10732-010-9143-1) and
[Multi-Parent BRKGA](http://dx.doi.org/xxx).
In the future, we will provide a _Prime on BRKGA-MP_
section. If you know what _elite set_, _decoder_, and so means,
we can get to the guts on the [Guide](@ref guide).

About the logo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The logo is just a play with 3 chromosomes crossing with each other
(multi-parent) during the mating process. The lines also represent solutions
paths that encounter with each other generating new solutions during the
path-relink.
