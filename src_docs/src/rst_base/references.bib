  abstract = {In last twenty years, telecommunication networks have experienced
    a huge increase in data utilization. From massive on-demand video to
    uncountable mobile devices exchanging text and video, traffic reached
    scales that overcame the network capacities. Therefore, telecommunication
    companies around the world have been forced to increase their capacity to
    serve this increasing demand. As the cost to deploy network infrastructure
    is usually very large, the design of a network heavily uses optimization
    tools to keep costs as low as possible. In this thesis, we analyze several
    aspects of the design and deployment of communication networks.},

    many industry and business process. Their optimized resolution leads to
    great profits in several sectors. A common problem, that occur in textile
    and paper industries, is to cut a strip of some material to obtain
    several small items, using the minimum length of material. This problem,
    known by Two Dimensional Strip Packing Problem (2SP), is a hard
    combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we present an exact
    algorithm to 2SP, restricted to two staged cuts (known by Two Dimensional
    Level Strip Packing, 2LSP). The algorithm uses the branch-and-price
    technique, and heuristics based on approximation algorithms to obtain
    upper bounds. The algorithm obtained optimal or almost optimal for small
    and moderate sized instances.},

      radio access networks used by the user equipment, like a smartphone, to
      identify the cell to connect. The PCI misassignment leads to call drops,
      no voice/data connections, and other sorts of impairments. Many works in
      the literature only treat the PCI assignment problem from the
      technological constraints viewpoint. In this work, we take a realistic
      approach and incorporate several operational constraints found daily in
      carrier-grade networks. For that, we model the problem with multiple
      objectives with a strict lexicographical dominance relation. We solve it
      using a hybrid memetic algorithm with warm start solutions obtained by a
      constraint programming solver and intensification with path-relinking and
      custom local search procedures. The experimental results suggest that our
      approach is superior to commercial solver packages in several scenarios.

      generalization of the classical Graph Coloring Problem, indicating that
      there must be a minimum distance for the assigned colors of two
      neighbors. For the RSI allocation, a maximal distance is also needed.
      We develop methods for allocating the RSI, while minimizing the risk of
      collisions, for two different operation modes found on carrier-grade
      networks.  Both exact and heuristic methods are explored and compared.
      We test the proposed approaches on instances obtained from real-life

  abstract = {Carbon Functional Materials (CFMs) such as biochar and hydrochar
    can be obtained from hundreds of biomass precursors varying from urban
      sludge to agriculture wastes. They can be produced through tens of
      synthesis methods and post-synthesis processing steps tuned each at
      specific conditions (e.g., temperature, time, and chemicals
          concentration). To achieve a “rational design” platform for a system
      with a high dimensional parameter space such as CFMs, we processed 10,975
      scientific articles (from years 2000 to 2020) related to the subject with
      automatic reading-interpreting-extracting computational routines (namely
          a.RIX engine). The a.RIX engine automatically recognized more than a
      hundred precursors, among which wheat straw, rice husk, and rice straw
      were the most studied for CFMs synthesis and application in agriculture
      (e.g., as an amendment), as a fuel (energy generation), and as an
      adsorbent. Parameters related to the CFMs synthesis conditions such as
      carbonization temperature and time, and parameters related to CFMs
      properties such as surface area and heavy metals adsorption capacity, can
      also be extracted from the articles. Correlations between the CFMs
      precursors and synthesis conditions indicated very little statistical
      difference between the carbonization temperature and time used for the
      CFMs synthesis from different precursors. Essentially, precursors are
      carbonized at temperatures varying from 100 to 900 oC for 30 min to six
      hours using pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, and gasification. When
      focusing the analysis just on CFMs produced by pyrolysis (biochar), we
      observed that peanut shells can produce materials with higher surface
      areas than other precursors (p < 0.05). When performing correlations
      between biochar synthesis conditions and their properties, general trends
      can be confirmed: (i) the higher the carbonization temperature, the lower
      the H/C and O/C ratios, and (ii) the increase in the surface area can be
      achieved by preserving a high aromatic degree (low H/C ratio) and a low
      oxidation level (low O/C ratio). However, a deeper understanding of the
      relation between CFMs synthesis/post-synthesis methods and the resulting
      properties can only be achieved using clustering algorithms (e.g.,
          k-means) and complex network analysis. The a.RIX engine groups
      articles describing optimized synthesis conditions and CFMs properties
      (e.g., low carbonization temperature, low carbonization time, and large
       surface area and adsorption capacity) and automatically recognizes the
      synthesis/post-synthesis steps used for these groups. The program
      efficiently recognized that precursors such as peanut shells can be
      converted into highly porous biochar by using experimental routes such as
      “pyrolysis” -> “activation” -> “drying” -> “ashing” -> “washing” ->
      “filtration.” With this approach, we show that a non-computational review
      of scientific articles for materials with a huge parameter space such as
      CFMs is largely obsolete. Finally, taken together, the results provide a
      powerful platform for data-oriented experimental design of CFMs produced
      from biomass.},

  Genetic Algorithm with Implicit Path-Relinking (BRKGA-MP-IPR), a variant of
  the Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm that employs multiple (biased)
  parents to generate offspring instead of the usual two, and is hybridized
  with a novel, implicit path-relinking local search procedure. By operating
  over the standard unit hypercube, such path-relinking mechanism leverages
  the population representation of the BRKGA and thus provides complete
  independence between the local search procedure and the problem definition
  and implementation. This approach contrasts with traditional path-relinking
  procedures that are tied to the problem structure. Having both BRKGA and
  IPR operate over the same solution space not only makes the
  intensification/diversification paradigm more natural but also greatly
  simplifies the development effort from the perspective of the practitioner,
  as one only needs to develop a decoder to map unit random-key vectors to
  the solution space of the problem on hand. Apart from such key benefits,
  extensive computational experiments solving real-world problems, such as
  over-the-air software upgrade scheduling, network design problems, and
  combinatorial auctions, show that the BRKGA-MP-IPR offers performance
  benefits over the standard BRKGA as well as the BRKGA with multiple
  parents.},

  abstract = {The p-next center problem is an extension of the classical
    p-center problem, in which a backup center must be assigned to welcome
      users from a suddenly unavailable center. Usually, users tend to seek
      help in the closest facility they can find. However, during a significant
      event or crisis, one only realizes that the closest facility has been
      disrupted upon his/her arrival. Therefore, the user seeks help in the
      next closest center from the one that has failed to provide service.
      Therefore, the objective of the p-next center problem is to minimize the
      path of any user, which is made by the distance from this origin to its
      closest installed facility, plus the distance from this facility to its
      backup. We propose an evolutionary approach for the p-next center problem
      and an extension for the current benchmark instances. The proposed
      methods are built on the Multi-Parent Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm
      with Implicit Path-Relinking. Computational experiments carried out on
      416 test instances show, experimentally, the outstanding performance of
      the developed algorithms and their flexibility to reach a good

    devices present several challenges, among them the software update of
    legacy and new devices using wireless connections. In this paper, we
    study a problem of scheduling massive Firmware-Over-The-Air updates for
    millions of connected cars. We model this problem as a new generic
    problem called Time- and Machine-Dependent Scheduling Problem (TMDSP)
    that resembles project scheduling problems with variable-intensity
    activities. In the TMDSP, jobs, machine utilization, and production rates
    vary over time. In each period, a given job can be executed by a subset
    of machines with different capacities and production rates. The objective
    is to deploy a feasible schedule with minimum total completion time. We
    explore solving the problem using several approaches among than Biased
    Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA), Iterated Local Search (ILS),
    Simulating Annealing (SA), two variations of Tabu Search (TB), and
    traditional genetic algorithms (TGA), in addition to a Mixed Integer
    Programming (MIP) model. We test the proposed approaches on a synthetic
    benchmark and very large real instances in IoT space. While using a
    commercial solver and the MIP model, we are able to solve only a few real
    instances (with, at most, 1,976 cars and 9,116 sectors); on the other

    problem, closely related to variants of the Steiner tree problem and the
    facility location problem. Given a parameter h, we want to build a forest
    where each tree has at most h hops from the demand nodes, where traffic
    originates, to the root nodes where each tree is rooted. Candidate
    Steiner nodes do not have any demand but represent locations where we can
    install cellsites to cover the traffic and equipment to backhaul the
    traffic to the cellular core network. Each Steiner node can cover demand
    nodes within a given distance, subject to a capacity constraint. The
    aggregate set of constraints may make it impossible to cover or backhaul
    all demands. A revenue function computes the revenue associated with the
    total amount of traffic covered and backhauled to the root nodes. The
    objective of the problem is to build a forest that maximizes the
    difference between the total revenue and the cost associated with the
    installed equipment. Although we will have a forest when we consider only
    the backhaul links and root nodes, the addition of demand vertices can
    induce undirected cycles, resulting in a directed acyclic graph. We
    consider instances of this problem with several additional constraints
    that are motivated by the requirements of real-world telecommunication
    networks.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a novel problem of facility location,
    called the p-next center problem with capacity and coverage radius
    constraints. We formulate a mixed integer programming model for this
    problem, and compare the results found by CPLEX with three Biased
    Random-Key Genetic Algorithms variants. We also propose several instances
    for this problem, based on existing ones for the p-next center problem.
    Additionally, we analyze the effect of the radius and demand on
    instance difficulty. We also observe the performance gains with a
    relaxed capacity and demand constraint, i.e., permitting demand to be
    unmet by the model. Results point that the BRKGA variants had
    significantly better performance than CPLEX, and similar performances
    among themselves. Of those, BRKGA-FI was shown to have slightly
    better results than the other variants.},

    cause collisions leading to failures on service establishment and
    performance degradation. In this study, we model the RSI allocation as a
    generalization of the classical Graph Coloring Problem, indicating that
    there must be a minimum distance for the assigned colors of two
    neighbors. For the RSI allocation, a maximal distance is also needed. We
    develop methods for allocating the RSI, while minimizing the risk of
    collisions, for two different operation modes found on carrier-grade
    networks. Both exact and heuristic methods are explored and compared. We
    test the proposed approaches on instances obtained from real-life context.

  abstract = {Networks undergo continuous changes to introduce new services
    and improve existing ones. Network change deployment involves carefully
    deciding when each change activity will be executed and who will be
    executing the change. This is a complex process because each service
    group has to plan its activities following a set of operational and
    technological constraints. Besides, multiple groups may be working on the
    same or dependent nodes at the same time, and they must co-ordinate their
    deployment plans. If they do not co-ordinate, conflicting change
    execution could result in unexpected impacts. Traditionally, change
    deployment has been a tedious and time-consuming task. To address this,
    we propose an innovative solution Zapper that aims for minimal human effort
    to coordinate the changes, minimal risk to service quality, and efficient
    plans to rapidly deploy the changes. Zapper maps change scheduling
    constraints into mathematical equations and then uses optimization
    algorithms to generate conflict-free change plans that satisfy all
    constraints across service groups. We have deployed Zapper at a large
    service provider and it is being used regularly by the network operations
    teams for more than two years to schedule over 4.5 million change
    activities.}

  abstract = {Since its introduction, mobile wireless communication has grown
  and changed substantially. This massive growth leads to different levels of
  complexity, mainly concerned with the assignment of different parameters to
  antennas or base stations. One parameter is the Root Sequence Index (RSI),
  related to the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) preambles, used to
  allocate uplink channels between the user equipment and the base station.
  The assignment of RSIs close-in-range to neighbor antennas may cause
  collisions, which are responsible for failures on service establishment,
  and therefore, performance degradation. Such allocation problems can be
  modeled as Graph Coloring Problems, including several additional
  constraints. However, few studies focus on RSI allocation and collisions
  from the optimization perspective. The objective of this study is to
  develop a method for allocating the RSI, trying to lessen the risk of
  collision and obeying other constraints. In this paper, we introduce an
  exact model for this problem alongside several instances extracted from a
  large carrier.},

  abstract  = {We consider the problem of managing Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA)
    updates for cars at a massive scale over a cellular network. This problem
    is constrained by factors like large number of cars, a need to perform
    updates quickly and securely, ability to do the update anywhere and any
    time, and delivering the often large update without harming the network.
    We present a scheduling approach for managing large FOTA downloads in a
    cellular network that combines historical network load with car usage and
    location analytics. The proposed approach uses a combination of
    heuristics and an optimized scheduler and applies them to schedule the
    admission of cars to download FOTA. Using real network data from a large
    cellular provider that includes a million cars and nearly a billion
    radio-level network connections, we show that our scheduling approach is
    feasible and practical. We also show that it is possible to manage FOTA
    even when device and network models use high levels of aggregation over
    time. Simulation results show that our method improves over random
    uncontrolled approaches by (i) reducing median download startup delay by
    48\%, (ii) reducing the number of cars that don't complete the update by
    10\% and most importantly, (iii) reducing the load in busy cells by up to
    37\%.},

  abstract  = {Connected cars are a rapidly growing segment of Internet of
    Things (IoT). While they already use cellular networks to support emergency
    response, in-car WiFi hotspots and infotainment, there is also a push
    towards updating their firmware over-the-air (FOTA). With millions of
    connected cars expected to be deployed over the next several years, and
    more importantly persist in the network for a long time, it is important
    to understand their behavior, usage patterns, and impact - both in
    terms of their experience, as well as other users. Using one million
    connected cars on a production cellular network, we conduct network-scale
    measurements of over one billion radio connections to understand various
    aspects including their spatial and temporal connectivity patterns, the
    network conditions they face, use and handovers across various radio
    frequencies and mobility patterns. Our measurement study reveals that
    connected cars have distinct sets of characteristics, including those
    similar to regular smartphones (e.g. overall diurnal pattern), those
    similar to IoT devices (e.g. mostly short network sessions), but also
    some that belong to neither type (e.g. high mobility). These insights are
    invaluable in understanding and modeling connected cars in a cellular
    network and in designing strategies to manage their data demand.},

  abstract   = {We demonstrate that a majority of modern random number
    generators, such as the newest version of rand.c, ranlux, and combined
      multiple recursive generators, have some manifest correlations in their
      outputs if the initial state is filled up using another linear recurrence
      with similar modulus. Among 58 available generators in the GNU scientific
      library, 40 show such defects. This is not because of the recursion, but
      because of carelessly chosen initialization schemes in the
      implementations. A good initialization scheme eliminates this
      phenomenon.},
